This assignment requires more individual learning than previous assignments - you are encouraged to check out the pandas documentation to find functions or methods you might not have used yet, or ask questions on Stack Overflow and tag them as pandas and python related. And of course, the discussion forums are open for interaction with your peers and the course staff.

Definitions:

    A quarter is a specific three month period, Q1 is January through March, Q2 is April through June, Q3 is July through September, Q4 is October through December.
    A recession is defined as starting with two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, and ending with two consecutive quarters of GDP growth.
    A recession bottom is the quarter within a recession which had the lowest GDP.
    A university town is a city which has a high percentage of university students compared to the total population of the city.

Hypothesis: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. Run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom. (price_ratio=quarter_before_recession/recession_bottom)
